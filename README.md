# Microsoft Mail Authentication & Sending Bot: Step-by-Step Implementation

Here's a detailed step-by-step guide for creating a Flask web application that authenticates with Microsoft's services and allows users to send emails:

## 1. Setting Up Your Development Environment
- Install Flask and required packages (flask, msal, requests) using uv

## 2. Microsoft App Registration
- Create a Microsoft Azure account if you don't have one
- Register a new application in Azure Active Directory
- Configure redirect URI to point to your Flask app callback endpoint
- Request appropriate permissions (Mail.Send, User.Read)
- Note down the client ID and client secret

## 3. Flask Application Structure
- Create a basic Flask app with the following routes:
  - Home page (/)
  - Auth callback (/auth-callback)
  - Dashboard (/dashboard)
  - Send email (/send-email)

## 4. Implementing User Authentication Flow
1. User visits your home page
2. Display a "Sign in with Microsoft" button and the device code
3. When clicked, redirect to the Microsoft Device Code flow
4. User goes to microsoft.com/devicelogin and enters the code
5. Microsoft redirects back to your callback URL with auth code
6. Exchange auth code for access tokens
7. Store tokens securely in user session

## 5. User Profile Retrieval
- After authentication, use tokens to make API calls to Microsoft Graph
- Retrieve user details (email, name, profile picture)
- Display user information on the dashboard

## 6. Email Composition Interface
- Create a form where users can paste HTML content
- Provide fields for email subject and recipient(s)
- Add a send button to trigger email sending

## 7. Email Sending Implementation
- Use Microsoft Graph API with access token to send emails
- Support HTML content in email body
- Handle API errors gracefully
- Show success/failure messages

## 8. Token Management
- Implement token refresh when expired
- Secure storage of tokens
- Logout functionality to clear tokens

## 9. UI Refinements
- Create a clean, responsive design
- Show loading indicators during API calls
- Add success/error notifications
